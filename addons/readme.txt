This file is added to "masterportal" repo to keep the "empty" addons folder. The addons folder is needed by webpack.
In case you need to clone an "addons" repository inside this folder, do the following:

1: Because cloning into a non empty folder is not allowed, DELETE THIS FILE BEFORE CLONING any repository inside this folder.
2: Clone the desired repository
3: Revert the deletion after cloning is finished.
